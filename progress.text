## Iteration 2 - Set up Supabase client, environment variables, database schema migration
- Installed @supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr packages
- Created .env.local and .env.example with NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY placeholders
- Created src/lib/supabase.ts (browser client using createBrowserClient with Database type)
- Created src/lib/supabase-server.ts (server client using createServerClient with cookie handling)
- Created src/types/supabase.ts (Database type definitions for all 6 tables: clients, projects, tasks, time_entries, notes, api_keys)
- Created supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql with full schema including:
  - All 6 tables with constraints and defaults
  - All indexes from PRD
  - updated_at triggers for auto-timestamping
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for authenticated users
- Files changed: package.json, package-lock.json, .env.local, .env.example, src/lib/supabase.ts, src/lib/supabase-server.ts, src/types/supabase.ts, supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - @supabase/ssr is the correct package for Next.js App Router (not @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs which is deprecated)
  - Browser client uses createBrowserClient, server uses createServerClient with cookie store
  - Server client's setAll needs try/catch because it can be called from Server Components where cookies are read-only
  - Database type generic on createBrowserClient<Database> and createServerClient<Database> provides type-safe queries
  - .env.local is gitignored by default in Next.js - .env.example serves as documentation
  - The schema includes updated_at triggers which the PRD didn't explicitly mention but are essential for data integrity
